Project Title: "Exploratory Data Analysis for Music Recommendation" 

The project focuses on analyzing a dataset of songs to improve music recommendation systems. The analysis aims to understand the dataset better, which contains information on song attributes like valence, acousticness, danceability, duration, and popularity. This project is particularly useful for streaming services like Spotify to make data-driven decisions and enhance their recommendation algorithms. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the project encourages the use of Spotify's public music analysis datasets for developers looking to create or improve recommendation systems.
